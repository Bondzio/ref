  Abstract                 = {Quantum chemical orbital optimizations can be accomplished by Newton-type iterations, whereall orbitals are improved ateach step; or by a succession of Jacobi rotations, where onlytwo orbitals are improved at any one step. In both schemes, the iterative updating of the four-index two-electron integrals requires a large computational effort. We show that the four-index transformation due to a Jacobi rotation can be simplified to such a degree that the successive execution of the four-index transformations ofN(N−1)/2 different Jacobi rotations requires no greater computational effort than that required by theone full orthogonal transformation which is the product of allN(N−1)/2 Jacobi rotations. The four-index updating has therefore no bearing on the relative merit of the Newton approach versus the Jacobi approach. The Jacobi approach has, however, an advantage if the optimization of each Jacobi rotation angle is simple and if the effectiveness of the individual Jacobi rotations can be assessed without the execution of four-index transformations. For, in that case, all ineffectual rotations are easily deleted from the iterative sequence. Whether convergence can be guaranteed for one or the other approach is also relevant. Our conclusions are illustrated by application to the problem of intrinsic orbital localization where the succession of Jacobi rotations is the more effective strategy.},

  Abstract                 = { The quasi-degenerate scaled opposite spin perturbation correction to single excitation configuration interaction (SOS-CIS(D0)) is a promising electronic structure method that can describe electronically excited states of sizable molecular systems. In this article, we report an assessment of the performance of SOS-CIS(D0) for adiabatic electronic transition energies and excited state equilibrium geometries for various small molecules. These tests allow optimization of the empirical scaling parameter in SOS-CIS(D0), and it is shown that one universal scaling parameter (chosen as 1.4) can satisfactorily reproduce the experimental results for all the tested molecules. The method is then applied to examine the large Stokes shift observed with a dihydrosilaphenanthrene derivative. The main features of the experimental absorption and emission spectra of this molecule are well reproduced by SOS-CIS(D0). },
