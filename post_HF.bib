	Corrections to Single Excitation Configuration Interaction for Excited

  abstract = { The quasi-degenerate scaled opposite spin perturbation correction
	to single excitation configuration interaction (SOS-CIS(D0)) is a
	promising electronic structure method that can describe electronically
	excited states of sizable molecular systems. In this article, we
	report an assessment of the performance of SOS-CIS(D0) for adiabatic
	electronic transition energies and excited state equilibrium geometries
	for various small molecules. These tests allow optimization of the
	empirical scaling parameter in SOS-CIS(D0), and it is shown that
	one universal scaling parameter (chosen as 1.4) can satisfactorily
	reproduce the experimental results for all the tested molecules.
	The method is then applied to examine the large Stokes shift observed
	with a dihydrosilaphenanthrene derivative. The main features of the
	experimental absorption and emission spectra of this molecule are
	well reproduced by SOS-CIS(D0). },
