  title = {Density Functional Theory -- an introduction},
  year = {1998},
  abstract = {Density Functional Theory (DFT) is one of the most widely used methods
	for ``ab initio'' calculations of the structure of atoms, molecules,
	crystals, surfaces, and their interactions. Unfortunately, the customary
	introduction to DFT is often considered too lengthy to be included
	in various curricula. An alternative introduction to DFT is presented
	here, drawing on ideas which are well-known from thermodynamics,
	especially the idea of switching between different independent variables.
	The central theme of DFT, i.e. the notion that it is possible and
	beneficial to replace the dependence on the external potential v(r)
	by a dependence on the density distribution n(r), is presented as
	a straightforward generalization of the familiar Legendre transform
	from the chemical potential (\mu) to the number of particles (N).
	This approach is used here to introduce the Hohenberg-Kohn energy
	functional and to obtain the corresponding theorems, using classical
	nonuniform fluids as simple examples. The energy functional for electronic
	systems is considered next, and the Kohn-Sham equations are derived.
	The exchange-correlation part of this functional is discussed, including
	both the local density approximation to it, and its formally exact
	expression in terms of the exchange-correlation hole. A very brief
	survey of various applications and extensions is included.},

  abstract = {The aim of this paper is to advocate the usefulness of the spin-density-functional
	(SDF) formalism. The generalization of the Hohenberg-Kohn-Sham scheme
	to and SDF formalism is presented in its thermodynamic version. The
	ground-state formalism is extended to more general Hamiltonians and
	to the lowest excited state of each symmetry. A relation between
	the exchange-correlation functional and the pair correlation function
	is derived. It is used for the interpretation of approximate versions
	of the theory, in particular the local-spin-density (LSD) approximation,
	which is formally valid only in the limit of slow and weak spatial
	variation in the density. It is shown, however, to give good account
	for the exchange-correlation energy also in rather inhomogeneous
	situations, because only the spherical average of the exchange-correlation
	hole influences this energy, and because it fulfills the sum rule
	stating that this hole should contain only one charge unit. A further
	advantage of the LSD approximation is that it can be systematically
	improved. Calculations on the homogeneous spin-polarized electron
	liquid are reported on. These calculations provide data in the form
	of interpolation formulas for the exchange-correlation energy and
	potentials, to be used in the LSD approximation. The ground-state
	properties are obtained from the Galitskii-Migdal formula, which
	relates the total energy to the one-electron spectrum, obtained with
	a dynamical self-energy. The self-energy is calculated in an electron-plasmon
	model where the electron is assumed to couple to one single mode.
	The potential for excited states is obtained by identifying the quasiparticle
	peak in the spectrum. Correlation is found to significantly weaken
	the spin dependence of the potentials, compared with the result in
	the Hartree-Fock approximation. Charge and spin response functions
	are calculated in the long-wavelength limit. Correlation is found
	to be very important for properties which involve a change in the
	spinpolarization. For atoms, molecules, and solids the usefulness
	of the SDF formalism is discussed. In order to explore the range
	of applicability, a few applications of the LSD approximation are
	made on systems for which accurate solutions exist. The calculated
	ionization potentials, affinities, and excitation energies for atoms
	propose that the valence electrons are fairly well described, a typical
	error in the ionization energy being 1/2 eV. The exchange-correlation
	holes of two-electron ions are discussed. An application to the hydrogen
	molecule, using a minimum basis set, shows that the LSD approximation
	gives good results for the energy curve for all separations studied,
	in contrast to the spin-independent local approximation. In particular,
	the error in the binding energy is only 0.1 eV, and bond breaking
	is properly described. For solids, the SDF formalism provides a framework
	for band models of magnetism. An estimate of the splitting between
	spin-up and spin-down energy bands of a ferromagnetic transition
	metal shows that the LSD approximation gives a correction of the
	correct sign and order of magnitude to published Xα results. To stimulate
	further use of the SDF formalism in the LSD approximation, the paper
	is self-contained and describes the necessary formulas and input
	data for the potentials.},

  abstract = {The exact exchange-correlation functional Exc[n] must be approximated
	in density-functional theory for the computation of electronic properties.
	By the coupling-constant integration (adiabatic-connection) formula
	we know that Exc[n]=F01(Veeα[n]-U[n])dα, where Veeα[n] is the electron-electron
	repulsion energy of Ψnmin,α, which is that wave function that yields
	the density n and minimizes 〈T^+αV^ee〉. Here α is the coupling constant.
	Consequently, knowledge of the behavior of Veeα[n] as a function
	of α ensures knowledge of Exc[n]. With this in mind and for the purpose
	of approximating Exc, it was previously established that (∂Veeα/∂α)≤0.
	The present paper reveals that Veeα[n]=αVee1[n1/α], where nβ(x,y,z)=β3n(βx,βy,βz),
	and where β is a coordinate scale factor.
	
	
	In other words, knowledge of Vee1[n] implies knowledge of Veeα[n]
	for all α. Alternatively, knowledge of Veeα[n] for some small α implies
	knowledge of all of the Veeα[n]. In any case, any viable approximation
	to Veeα[n] should be made to satisfy the above displayed equality.
	Analogous conclusions hold for the second-order density matrix, the
	pair-correlation function, the exchange-correlation hole, and the
	correlation component of the exchange-correlation hole, etc. For
	example, ρxc([n,α];r1,r2)=α3ρxc([n1/α,1]; αr1,αr2), where ρxc([n,α];
	r1,r2) is the exact exchange-correlation hole of Ψnmin,α.
	
	
	(A corresponding expression holds for the correlation hole alone.)
	Further, when n belongs to a noninteracting ground state that is
	nondegenerate, then limα→0 Veeα[n]=A[n]+fn(α)B[n]+..., where fn(α)
	must vanish at least as rapidly as α, and limλ→∞ Ec[nλ]>-∞, where
	Ec[n]=Exc[n]- limγ→∞ γ-1Exc[nγ], and where Ec is a familiar exact
	density-functional ‘‘correlation energy.’’ In contrast, in the local-density
	approximation and in certain nonlocal approximations, fn(α) is replaced
	by a function that goes as α[ln(α-1)], α→0, and Ec is replaced by
	a functional that is unbounded as λ→∞. Further, limλ→∞ Exc[nλx]>-∞
	and limλ→∞ Ex[nλx]>-∞, which are also not generally satisfied by
	common approximations. Here nλx(x,y,z)=λn(λx,y,z) and Ex is a familiar
	exact density-functional ‘‘exchange energy.’’ Finally, comparison
	is made between Ec and the traditional quantum-mechanical correlation
	energy, which is expressed exactly as a functional of the Hartree-Fock
	density.},
