	optimizations for low-lying excited states of 20 small molecules,
	and compared adiabatic excitation energies and optimized geometry
	parameters to experimental values using the B3LYP and {\"I}?B97 functionals.
	There are only minor differences between TDDFT and TDA optimized
	excited state geometries and adiabatic excitation energies. Optimized
	bond lengths are in better agreement with experiment for both functionals
	than either CC2 or SOS-CIS(D<sub>0</sub>), while adiabatic excitation
	energies are in similar or slightly poorer agreement. Optimized bond

	functional response theory: Consistent formalism, implementation,
	and performance},
  journal = {The Journal of chemical physics},
  year = {2010},
  volume = {132},
  pages = {044107},
  abstract = {First-order nonadiabatic coupling matrix elements (NACMEs) are key
	for phenomena such as nonradiative transitions and excited-state
	decay, yet a consistent and practical first principles treatment
	has been elusive for molecules with more than a few heavy atoms.
	Here we present theory, implementation using Gaussian basis sets,
	and benchmarks of first-order NACMEs between ground and excited states
	in the framework of time-dependent hybrid density functional theory
	(TDDFT). A time-dependent response approach to NACMEs which avoids
	explicit computation of excited-state wave functions is outlined.
	In contrast to previous approaches, the present treatment produces
	exact analytical derivative couplings between time-dependent Kohn–Sham
	(TDKS) determinants in a finite atom-centered basis set. As in analytical
	gradient theory, derivative molecular orbital coefficients can be
	eliminated, making the computational cost independent of the number
	of nuclear degrees of freedom. Our expression reduces to the exact
	Chernyak–Mukamel formula for first-order NACMEs in the complete basis-set
	limit, but greatly improves basis-set convergence in finite atom-centered
	basis sets due to additional Pulay type terms. The Chernyak–Mukamel
	formula is shown to be equivalent to the Hellmann–Feynman contribution
	in analytical gradient theory. Our formalism may be implemented in
	TDDFT analytical excited-state gradient codes with minor modifications.
	Tests for systems with up to 147 atoms show that evaluation of first-order
	NACMEs causes total computation times to increase by an insignificant
	10% on average. The resolution-of-the-identity approximation for
	the Coulomb energy (RI-J) reduces the computational cost by an order
	of magnitude for nonhybrid functionals, while errors are insignificant
	with standard auxiliary basis sets. We compare the computed NACMEs
	to full configuration interaction (FCI) in benchmark results for
	diatomic molecules; hybrid TDDFT and FCI are found to be in agreement
	for regions of the potential energy curve where the Kohn–Sham ground-state
	reference is stable and the character of the excitation is properly
	captured by the present functionals. With these developments, nonadiabatic
	molecular dynamics simulations of molecular systems in the 100 atoms
	regime are within reach.},
