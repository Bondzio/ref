  Abstract                 = {The quadratically convergent Hartree-Fock (QC-SCF) method that was recently developed has been extended to the calculation of open shell restricted Hartree-Fock (RHF) wavefunctions. In analogy with recent work on \{SCF\} and MC-SCF methods the theory is based on the unitary transformation of the orbital basis and is developed using the formalism of second quantization. Two methods of orbital optimization are presented, the Newton-Raphson and an approximate super \{CI\} approach, the former technique being directly applicable to coupled perturbed Hartree-Fock calculations. The computational scheme that was developed for \{UHF\} and closed shell \{RHF\} cases is shown to be applicable to open shell \{RHF\} wavefunctions too, i.e. no 4-index transformation is necessary. The results of test calculations for the \{BO\} and \{NO\} molecules indicate that the QC-SCF orbital optimization scheme compares favourably with a conventional method and is most efficient if a high degree of convergence is sought. The results of polarizability calculations, where QC-SCF is demonstrated to be particularly efficient, are also presented for the \{NO\} and \{O2\} molecules.},

  Abstract                 = {Using \{CI\} formalism the theory of a quadratically convergent Hartree—Fock method is developed which is shown to be a simple extension of single excitation \{CI\} and closely related to coupled Hartree-Fock perturbation theory. A computationally efficient practical scheme is proposed in which the costly four-index transformation step inherent in \{CI\} methods is avoided. Test calculations for the H2O, CO, C2H2N+ systems and for \{N2\} perturbed by a finite electric field indicate that the current scheme is significantly more efficient than the widely used conventional Hartree—Fock method and is especially useful in coupled Hartree—Fock and finite field perturbation calculations. },

  Abstract                 = {Recently, we have introduced a method based on geometric considerations, termed geometric direct minimization (GDM), to achieve robust convergence of self consistent field calculations. GDM was limited to calculations involving either spin-unrestricted orbitals or closed shell systems. We report the extension of the GDM method to treat open shell systems involving spin-restricted orbitals. Open shell systems pose a challenge for achieving robust convergence of the calculation. We compare the convergence using the GDM method to the convergence achieved by the well known direct inversion in the iterative space (DIIS) technique. This comparison demonstrates the ability of the GDM method to achieve robust convergence. Additionally we assess the importance of geometric considerations by comparing against an alternative direct minimization method that is not geometrically correct. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]},

Although the procedure is well known for closed-shell calculations and was already suggested when the Direct SCF procedure was proposed, the general procedure is less obvious. For instance, there is no need to converge the corresponding closed-shell HartreeÃ¢ÂÂFock calculation when dealing with an open-shell species. We describe the various choices and illustrate them with test calculations, showing that the procedure is easier, and on average better, than starting from a converged minimal basis calculation and much better than using a bare nucleus Hamiltonian.

  Abstract                 = {The approach presented, geometric direct minimization (GDM), is derived from purely geometrical arguments, and is designed to minimize a function of a set of orthonormal orbitals. The optimization steps consist of sequential unitary transformations of the orbitals, and convergence is accelerated using the Broyden-Fletcher-Goldfarb-Shanno (BFGS) approach in the iterative subspace, together with a diagonal approximation to the Hessian for the remaining degrees of freedom. The approach is tested by implementing the solution of the self-consistent field (SCF) equations and comparing results with the standard direct inversion in the iterative subspace (DIIS) method. It is found that GDM is very robust and converges in every system studied, including several cases in which DIIS fails to find a solution. For main group compounds, GDM convergence is nearly as rapid as DIIS, whereas for transition metal-containing systems we find that GDM is significantly slower than DIIS. A hybrid procedure where DIIS is used for the first several iterations and GDM is used thereafter is found to provide a robust solution for transition metal-containing systems.},
