  abstract = {The Dirac variation-of-constants method has long provided a basis
	for perturbative solution of the time-dependent Schrödinger equation.
	In spite of its widespread utilization, certain aspects of the method
	have been discussed only superficially and remain somewhat obscure.
	The present review attempts to clarify some of these points, particularly
	those related to secular and normalization terms. Secular terms arise
	from an over-all time-dependent phase in the wave function, while
	normalization terms preserve the norm of the wave function. A proper
	treatment of the secular terms is essential in the presence of a
	physically significant level shift that can produce secular divergences
	in the time-dependent perturbation functions. The normalization terms
	are always important, although the formulation of a simple method
	for including them is of greatest utility in applications requiring
	higher-order perturbation theory (e.g., nonlinear optical phenomena),
	where difficulties have arisen in previous treatments. Although the
	Dirac perturbation technique includes the correct secular and normalization
	terms when properly executed, it is convenient to reinterpret the
	perturbation problem so that the secular and normalization terms
	can be factored from the wave function to all orders. It is shown
	that an appropriate over-all multiplicative, time-dependent normalization
	and phase factor can be obtained, and that it is simply the amplitude
	for finding the system in the unperturbed eigenstate at any time
	t. The regular part of the wave function remaining after this factorization
	provides a complete description of the physical properties of the
	system of interest and determines the over-all normalization and
	phase, as well. Most important, the regular function and its perturbation
	expansion satisfy equations which are more convenient for computational
	applications than are the customary Dirac equations, and, in contrast
	to the latter, they reduce directly to the familiar time-independent
	perturbation equations in the static limit. To illustrate the general
	development, the model problem of a linearly perturbed harmonic oscillator
	and the static, harmonic, and electromagnetic perturbations of arbitrary
	quantum-mechanical systems are treated explicitly. In the case of
	an adiabatically applied static perturbation, the familiar adiabatic
	theorem is recovered with the over-all phase factor giving the perturbed
	eigenvalue, while in the case of an harmonic perturbation, the overall
	phase factor obtained includes the system level shift appropriate
	for a quasiperiodic state. For an electromagnetic perturbation, compact
	expressions are obtained for various nonlinear optical susceptibilities
	in forms suitable for computations. Time-dependent Hartree-Fock approximations
	are treated explicity to demonstrate that difficulties can arise
	when normalization and secular terms are not extracted prior to application
	of the perturbation formalism. Connection is also made with other
	methods which can be employed to eliminate secular and normalization
	terms from the wave function; these include a projection procedure
	and multiple-time-scales perturbation theory. The elimination of
	secular divergences from the perturbation functions is shown to be
	important for the construction of a valid Fourier transform. Secular
	and normalization terms also arise in connection with variational
	principles for the time-dependent Schrödinger equation. By employing
	the Frenkel variational principle and an ansatz for the total wave
	function that explicitly isolates the secular and normalization terms,
	a computationally convenient variational functional is obtained.
	This form of the Frenkel principle provides a bound to the system
	level shift induced by an oscillatory perturbation and is equivalent
	to the Ritz variational principle in the static limit. Explicit expressions
	for the variational functional in the Hartree-Fock approximations
	are derived in forms suitable for computational applications to the
	interactions of radiation and matter.},

  number = {2},
  abstract = {A detailed examination is made of several approximations to the first-order
	Hartree—Fock perturbation equation. Four distinct methods are considered:
	the coupled (Method a) and the uncoupled (Method c) approximation
	of Dalgarno, a new alternative uncoupled approximation (Method b),
	and the simplified uncoupled approximation of Karplus and Kolker
	(Method d). By a comparison of the pertinent equations, it is shown
	that Methods a, b, and d correspond to each other in the use of a
	core potential analogous to that appearing in the zeroth-order Hartree—Fock
	equation, while Method c differs due to the inclusion of an extraneous
	self-potential term. An alternative analysis based on an orbital
	basis set expansion of the perturbed function demonstrates that Method
	c has an energy denominator of the simple Hückel type, while both
	Methods a and b include important two-electron correction terms.
	Also, it is found that of the four approximations, only Method c
	can be obtained as the first-order correction with a zeroth-order
	many-electron Hamiltonian that has the Hartree—Fock determinant as
	its eigenfunction; the other techniques are one electron in character,
	as is the Hartree—Fock method itself.The significance of the difference
	in the core potential is demonstrated by test calculations of dipole
	and quadrupole polarizabilities and shielding factors for the two-,
	three-, and four-electron isoelectronic series. A variational technique
	is used with a trial function that has the form of a polynomial times
	the unperturbed orbital. For the polarizabilities, it is found that
	Method b is an excellent approximation to Method a, indicating that
	the self-consistency condition on the Method a solutions has a very
	small effect. The shielding factors, however, appear to be more sensitive
	to the self-consistency requirement. Both Method c and Method d introduce
	larger errors than Method b, with Method c particularly poor for
	three-electron atoms and ions. The constraint introduced by choice
	of trial function is shown to be unimportant for polarizabilities,
	but quite severe for the four-electron atom shielding factors.A comparison
	of the complexity of the various techniques shows that the relative
	computing times for Methods a, b, c, and d are in the ratio of 300
	to 60 to 75 to 1. Thus, Method d is simplest by far, although its
	speed is achieved by some loss of accuracy with respect to Methods
	a and b.},

	An alternative (necessary and sufficient) condition for a solution

  abstract = {A method for calculating the EPR g-tensor based on coupled perturbed
	Hartree–Fock (HF) and density functional theory (DFT) is presented.
	The one-electron molecular orbitals of a spin- unrestricted Slater
	determinant are calculated up to first order in the applied magnetic
	field. The g-tensor is evaluated as a mixed second derivative property
	with respect to the applied field and the electron magnetic moment.
	Thus, spin-polarization and spin–orbit coupling are simultaneously
	included in the calculation. The treatment focuses on orbitally nondegenerate
	molecules but is valid for a general ground state spin S and, for
	the first time, it is possible to include hybrid density functionals
	in the treatment. The relativistic mass and diamagnetic gauge corrections
	are also considered. An implementation of the theory is described.
	Extensive numerical calculations for a series of small molecules
	are reported with the Hartree–Fock (HF) method, the local density
	approximation (LSD), the generalized gradient approximation (GGA)
	and hybrid density functionals such as B3LYP and PBE0 and large Gaussian
	basis sets. Detailed comparison with available ab initio and DFT
	calculations are made. The results indicate that the hybrid functionals
	offer little or no improvement over the GGA functionals for small
	radicals made of light atoms. For transition metal complexes the
	situation is different. The hybrid functionals give, on average,
	better results than the GGA functionals but significant disagreement
	between theoretical and experimental g-shifts still remain. Overall,
	the results indicate that the present method is among the most accurate
	so far developed models for the prediction of g values.},
