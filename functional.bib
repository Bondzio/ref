  Abstract                 = {Local hybrid functionals with position-dependent exact-exchange admixture are a promising new generation of exchange-correlation functionals for a large variety of applications. So far, the local mixing functions (LMFs) determining the position dependence have been largely constructed in an ad hoc manner, albeit based on physical reasoning. Here the basic formalism of the adiabatic connection is employed to investigate the formal basis of local hybrids and to construct a priori LMFs. Both a local spin density approximation to the LMF (AC-LSDA LMF) and generalized gradient approximation approximations (AC-PW91 LMF and AC-PBE LMF) turn out to provide inferior performance when used in local hybrids to compute atomization energies and reaction barriers compared to previous semiempirical LMFs. This is rationalized by limited flexibility of these first-principles LMFs and some basic limitations of the adiabatic connection formalism in this context. Graphical analyses and formal considerations provide nevertheless important new insight into the physical background of local hybrid functionals.},

  Abstract                 = {The localized Hartree–Fock approximation is applied to convert `traditional' non-local and non-multiplicative hybrid exchange-correlation potentials into local and multiplicative Kohn–Sham potentials for the open-shell case, within the spin-unrestricted formalism. The method has been evaluated in calculations of g-tensors for nine first-row transition-metal compounds. Local potentials allow one to improve the results by increasing the exact exchange admixture to a certain limit, whereas this is more difficult for non-local potentials. Exact-exchange admixture of ca. 0.5 provides the best agreement with the experimental g-tensors which is consistent with previous local hybrid potential results for nuclear shielding constants of closed-shell main-group molecules.},

  Abstract                 = {A comparison is made between traditional quantum chemical approaches to the electron correlation problem and the one taken in density functional theory (DFT). Well-known concepts of DFT, such as the exchange−correlation energy Exc = ∫ρ(r) εxc(r) dr and the exchange−correlation potential vxc(r) are related to electron correlation as described in terms of density matrices and the conditional amplitude (Fermi and Coulomb holes). The Kohn−Sham one-electron or orbital model of DFT is contrasted with Hartree−Fock, and the definitions of exchange and correlation in DFT are compared with the traditional ones. The exchange−correlation energy density εxc(r) is decomposed into kinetic and electron−electron potential energy components, and a practical way of calculating these from accurate wave functions is discussed, which offers a route to systematic improvement. vxc(r) is likewise decomposed, and special features (bond midpoint peak, various types of step behavior) are identified and related to electronic correlation.},

  Abstract                 = {The local density theory is developed by Hohenberg, Kohn and Sham is extended to the spin polarized case. A spin dependent one- electron potential pertinent to ground state properties is obtained from calculations of the total energy per electron made with a 'bubble' (or random phase) type of dielectric function. The potential is found to be well represented by an analytic expression corresponding to a shifted and rescaled spin dependent Slater potential. To test this potential the momentum dependent spin susceptibility of an electron gas is calculated. The results compare favourably with available information from other calculations and from experiment. The potential obtained in this paper should be useful for split band calculations of magnetic materials.},

The dimensionless parameter rs is the radius of the unit sphere in Bohr radii. The term in rs-1 is the energy of a body-centered cubic lattice of electrons as calculated by Fuchs; the rs-3 / 2 term is the zero-point vibrational energy of the lattice, as obtained from a calculation of the normal modes, the result differing only by a small amount from the values estimated by Wigner; and brs-2 is the first-order effect of anharmonicities in the vibration. The constant b has been estimated, its magnitude being smaller than unity. The vibrational part of the specific heat has been calculated, and a first-order approximation has been obtained for the exponential terms in the energy. Part of this energy comes from exchange, which leads to the result that, except for very low densities (rs≳270), the electron spins are antiferromagnetically aligned. An order of magnitude for the Néel temperature has been calculated.},

The value of the coefficient of rslnrs is evaluated, and it is found to differ from the value obtained by DuBois. The result of the present calculation for the energy per electron is E=2.21rs-2-0.916rs-1+0.0622lnrs-0.096+0.018rslnrs+(E3-0.036)rs+O(rs2lnrs), where E3 is a sum of twelve dimensional integrals. Although E3 has not been evaluated it is shown with the aid of the virial theorem that no reasonable value of E3 can make the series expansion rapidly convergent beyond rs approximates to 1. Under the rather arbitrary assumption that E3rs as well as higher order terms can be neglected below rs=1, an interpolation between the present result and the low-density expansion is carried out, and values of the correlation energy in the region of metallic densities are estimated.},

  Abstract                 = {At very low densities an electron gas in a compensating uniform background of positive charge crystallizes into a bcc lattice for which the correlation energy per electron is (–1.792/rs) ry. At higher densities the first correction to this result arises from the zero point energy of the electrons, which can be expanded in terms of the even moments of the frequency spectrum. We have computed the first five nonvanishing moments and have estimated the contribution to the zero point energy from the remaining moments using their known asymptotic behavior. This procedure leads to the value for the zero point energy per electron. The low temperature specific heat per electron is found to be 56.21krs9/2· (kT)3 ry.

  Abstract                 = {ABSTRACT For dealing with atoms involving many electrons the accurate quantum theory, involving a solution of the wave equation in many-dimensional space, is far too complicated to be practicable. One must therefore resort to approximate methods. The best of these is Hartree's method of the self-consistent field. Even this, however, is hardly practicable when one has to deal with very many electrons, so that one then requires a still simpler and rougher method. Such a method is provided by Thomas' atomic model, in which the electrons are regarded as forming a perfect gas satisfying the Fermi statistics and occupying the region of phase space of lowest energy. This region of phase space is assumed to be saturated, with two electrons with opposite spins in each volume (2&#960;h)3, and the remainder is assumed to be empty. Although this model hitherto has not been justified theoretically, it seems to be a plausible approximation for the interior of a heavy atom and one may expect it to give with some accuracy the distribution of electric charge there.},

The knowledge of the exact electronic density allows us to construct the exact exchange–correlation potential and exchange–correlation energy by inverting the Kohn–Sham equation. The exact exchange–correlation potential and energy are compared with the corresponding quantities, obtained for the same densities, using approximate density functionals, namely the local density approximation and several generalized gradient approximations. We consider two values of the spring constant in order to study the system in the low correlation case (high value of the spring constant) and in the high correlation case (low value of the spring constant). In both cases, the exchange–correlation potentials corresponding to approximate density functionals differ from the exact one over the entire spatial range. The approximate correlation potentials bear no resemblance to the exact ones. The exchange energy for generalized gradient approximation functionals is much improved compared to the result obtained within the local density approximation but the correlation energy is only a little improved.},

The value of A is found to be 0.0622, a result that could be deduced from previous work of Wigner, Macke, and Pines. An exact formula for the constant C is given here for the first time; earlier workers had made only approximate calculations of C. Further, it is shown how the next correction in rs can be computed. The method is based on summing the most highly divergent terms of the perturbation series under the integral sign to give a convergent result. The summation is performed by a technique similar to Feynman's methods in field theory.},

  Abstract                 = {The theory developed in a previous paper is applied to calculate the correlation energy of a free-electron gas. The theory involves on cut-off and gives a uniform description of collective motion effects in the long-range limit and of particle motion effects in the short-range limit. It is shown that in the lowest order the theory agrees with Bohm & Pines's plasma oscillation theory in the long-range limit, but is inadequate in the short-range limit. The theory is approximately evaluated to the next order, which is correct in the short-range limit, and is applied to calculate the correlation energy at several gas densities; the results are in good agreement with those of Bohm & Pines.},

We test two limiting cases: screened local hybrids with no long-range HF exchange and long-range-corrected local hybrids with 100% long-range HF exchange. Long-range-corrected local hybrids provide the exact asymptotic exchange-correlation potential in finite systems, while screened local hybrids avoid the problems inherent to long-range HF exchange in metals and small-bandgap systems. We treat these functionals self-consistently using the nonlocal exchange potential constructed from Kohn-Sham orbital derivatives. Generalized Kohn-Sham calculations with screened and long-range-corrected local hybrids can provide accurate molecular thermochemistry and kinetics, comparable to existing local hybrids of full-range exchange. Generalized Kohn-Sham calculations with existing full-range local hybrids provide results consistent with previous non-self-consistent and “localized local hybrid” calculations. These new functionals appear to provide a promising extension of existing local and range-separated hybrids.},

The scheme is applied to planar surface calculations, as well as to extensive self-consistent calculations of energies and densities in atoms. The results compare favorably, in every case attempted, to experimental and exact results that are available. A method is devised for separating exchange from correlation in atoms within the Kohn-Sham method, and is tested favorably against exact-exchange calculations. Finally, we apply these results to atoms using exact exchange plus our appropriately separated correlation expression. The results give atomic total energies to accuracies of ∼±0.01 Ry, and typically reduce the local-density-approximation error in density by an order of magnitude.},

  Abstract                 = {By the Hellmann-Feynman theorem, the density n(r) of many electrons in the presence of external potential v(r) obeys the relationships Fd3r n(r)∇v(r)=0 and Fd3r n(r)r×∇v(r)=0. By the virial theorem, the interacting kinetic and electron-electron repulsion expectation values obey 2T[n]+Vee[n]=-Fd3r n(r)r⋅∇[δT/δn(r)+δVee/δn(r)]. The exchange energy functional Ex[n] and potential vx([n];r)≡δEx/δn(r) must satisfy Ex[n]+Fd3r n(r)r⋅∇vx([n];r)=0, while the correlation energy and potential must satisfy Ec[n]+Fd3r n(r)r⋅∇vc([n];r)<0. Somewhat counterintuitively, it is not true that T[nγ]=γ2T[n] and Vee[nγ]=γVee[n], where nγ(r)≡γ3n(γr) is a scaled density with scale factor γ≠1. In fact, it is impossible to partition the exact Hohenberg-Kohn functional into a piece that scales as γ2 and a piece that scales as γ, even if complete freedom with the partitioning is allowed. Instead there are universal scaling inequalities. For instance, T[nγ]+Vee[nγ]<γ2T[n]+ γVee[n] and T[nγ]+γVee[nγ]>γ2(T[n ]+Vee[n]), and consequent inequalities involving Ec[n]. All the above virial and scaling requisites are universal in that they are independent of external potential and they must hold for arbitrary proper n. In addition, for the ground-state energy (E) and n of any atom or molecule at its equilibrium nuclear configuration, there is the inequality E<-Ts[n], where Ts is the noninteracting kinetic energy. In the closed-shell tight-binding limit, the correlation potential obeys Fd3r n(r)r⋅∇vc([n];r)=0, and so cannot be a monotonic function of r for an atom in this limit. Further, (∂/∂γ)Ec[nγ]‖γ=1=E c[n]+Tc[n]=-Fd3r n(r)r⋅∇vc([n];r), which implies that the exact Ec should be fairly insensitive to scaling. With the help of the ionization-potential theorem, it is argued that the exact vc([n];r) in an atom often has a positive part. Common approximations to the correlation potential are examined for their effects upon the highest occupied Kohn-Sham orbital energy and the density moment 〈r2〉, and these effects are found to be related. Further improvements needed in the approximate correlation potentials are relatively large, but not nearly so large as those recently suggested for the atoms Ne, Ar, Kr, and Xe: The discrepancy between theoretical values of 〈r2〉 from Hartree-Fock or configuration-interaction calculations, and experimental values from measured diamagnetic susceptibilities, is tentatively resolved in favor of theory.},

  Abstract                 = {The correlation energy (the exact energy minus the Hartree-Fock energy) of an electron gas with a high and slowly varying density is examined. The term proportional to the square of the density gradient is evaluated by the application of perturbation theory to the external field and of the random-phase (or high-density) approximation to the Coulomb interaction. This term has the form ΔEc[ρ]=∫d3xB(ρ(x))|∇ρ(x)|2, where ρ(x) is the electron density. B(ρ) is found, by summing the leading divergent diagrams, to be [8.470×10-3+O(ρ-1 / 3lnρ)+O(ρ-1 / 3)]ρ-4 / 3 Ry, with the length measured in units of the Bohr radius. The role of the density gradient in the correlation energy problem of atoms is discussed.},

As an example the authors consider the expansions of T up to fourth order in the gradients of n, and of n up to fourth order in the gradients of V. These expansions are tested for the extreme case of one- and two-electron atoms. It is found that (i) The n[V] expansion contains serious pathologies, while the T[n] expansion leads to much more reasonable results when applied to either the exact density n(r→) or to an n(r→) obtained by minimization of the approximate total-energy functional E[n]. (ii) Good approximations to E and n(r→) in one-electron atoms are obtained only when the complete spin polarization of a single electron is taken into account via T[n↑, n↓]. (iii) Within a variational calculation, the inclusion of second- and fourth-order gradient corrections to the zeroth-order (Thomas-Fermi) approximation for T leads to systematic improvements in the analytic behavior of n(r→) near the nucleus. The authors also compare the local-exchange approximation with the local-exchange-correlation approximation in one- and two-electron atoms, and find that correlation should not be neglected.},

  Abstract                 = {Generalized gradient approximations (GGA’s) seek to improve upon the accuracy of the local-spin-density (LSD) approximation in electronic-structure calculations. Perdew and Wang have developed a GGA based on real-space cutoff of the spurious long-range components of the second-order gradient expansion for the exchange-correlation hole. We have found that this density functional performs well in numerical tests for a variety of systems: (1) Total energies of 30 atoms are highly accurate. (2) Ionization energies and electron affinities are improved in a statistical sense, although significant interconfigurational and interterm errors remain. (3) Accurate atomization energies are found for seven hydrocarbon molecules, with a rms error per bond of 0.1 eV, compared with 0.7 eV for the LSD approximation and 2.4 eV for the Hartree-Fock approximation. (4) For atoms and molecules, there is a cancellation of error between density functionals for exchange and correlation, which is most striking whenever the Hartree-Fock result is furthest from experiment. (5) The surprising LSD underestimation of the lattice constants of Li and Na by 3–4 % is corrected, and the magnetic ground state of solid Fe is restored. (6) The work function, surface energy (neglecting the long-range contribution), and curvature energy of a metallic surface are all slightly reduced in comparison with LSD. Taking account of the positive long-range contribution, we find surface and curvature energies in good agreement with experimental or exact values. Finally, a way is found to visualize and understand the nonlocality of exchange and correlation, its origins, and its physical effects.},

  Abstract                 = {The ground-state energy and density of a many-electron system are often calculated by Kohn-Sham density functional theory. We describe a ladder of approximations for the exchange-correlation energy as a functional of the electron density. At the lowest rung of this ladder, the contribution to the energy from a volume element of 3-dimensional space is determined by the local density there. Higher rungs or levels incorporate increasingly complex ingredients constructed from the density or the Kohn-Sham orbitals in or around this volume element. We identify which additional exact conditions can be satisfied at each level, and discuss the extent to which the functionals at each level may be constructed without empirical input. We also discuss the research that remains to be done at the exact-exchange level, and present our "dreams of a final theory". "Jacob left Beer-sheba and went toward Haran.

Within the random-phase approximation (RPA), this representation allows for the rs-3/4 behavior as rs→∞. Close agreement with numerical RPA values for ɛc(rs,0), ɛc(rs,1), and the spin stiffness αc(rs)=∂2ɛc(rs, ζ=0)/δζ2, and recovery of the correct rslnrs term for rs→0, indicate the appropriateness of the chosen analytic form. Beyond RPA, different parameters for the same analytic form are found by fitting to the Green’s-function Monte Carlo data of Ceperley and Alder [Phys. Rev. Lett. 45, 566 (1980)], taking into account data uncertainties that have been ignored in earlier fits by Vosko, Wilk, and Nusair (VWN) [Can. J. Phys. 58, 1200 (1980)] or by Perdew and Zunger (PZ) [Phys. Rev. B 23, 5048 (1981)]. While we confirm the practical accuracy of the VWN and PZ representations, we eliminate some minor problems with these forms. We study the ζ-dependent coefficients in the high- and low-density expansions, and the rs-dependent spin susceptibility. We also present a conjecture for the exact low-density limit. The correlation potential μcσ(rs,ζ) is evaluated for use in self-consistent density-functional calculations.},

We present an analytic representation of g¯ (and hence g) in real space for a uniform electron gas with density parameter rs and spin polarization ζ. This expression has the following attractive features: (1) The exchange-only contribution is treated exactly, apart from oscillations we prefer to ignore. (2) The correlation contribution is correct in the high-density (rs→0) and nonoscillatory long-range (R→∞) limits. (3) The value and cusp are properly described in the short-range (R→0) limit. (4) The normalization and energy integrals are respected. The result is found to agree with the pair-distribution function g from Ceperley’s quantum Monte Carlo calculation.

The basis for this approximation is the gradient expansion of the exchange hole, with real-space cutoffs chosen to guarantee that the hole is negative everywhere and represents a deficit of one electron. Unlike the previously publsihed version of it, this functional is simple enough to be applied routinely in self-consistent calculations for atoms, molecules, and solids. Calculated exchange energies for atoms fall within 1% of Hartree-Fock values. Significant improvements over other simple functionals are also found in the exchange contributions to the valence-shell removal energy of an atom and to the surface energy of jellium within the infinite barrier model.},

The four linear parameters of B05 are re-optimized together with one extra parameter in a modified expression for the second-order same-spin energy contribution. The latter is co-linear with the exact-exchange energy density and does not require higher moments of the relaxed exchange hole. Preliminary tests of this method show that it leads to a slight improvement over the resolution-of-identity B05 results reported previously for atomization energies, and to a definite improvement for reaction barriers of Hydrogen abstraction.},

The theory permits calculation of the ground-state density and energy of a many-electron system (e.g., an atom, molecule, or solid) by the selfconsistent solution of a one-electron Schroedinger equation. The theory is exact in principle for these quantities, and in practice the required approximations can be usefully accurate. Here, with few equations and without any claim of optimal selection, we present 12 problems in density functional theory that remain to be solved, with an emphasis on formal problems and on the construction of approximate density functionals.

  Abstract                 = {The objective of this work is the further systematic improvement of the accuracy of Double-Hybrid Density Functionals (DHDF) that add non-local electron correlation effects to a standard hybrid functional by second-order perturbation theory (S. Grimme{,} {,} 2006{,} {,} 034108). The only known shortcoming of these generally highly accurate functionals is an underestimation of the long-range dispersion (van der Waals) interactions. To correct this deficiency{,} we add a previously developed empirical dispersion term (DFT-D) to the energy expression but leave the electronic part of the functional untouched. Results are presented for the S22 set of non-covalent interaction energies{,} the G3/99 set of heat of formations and conformational energies of a phenylalanyl-glycyl-glycine peptide model. We furthermore propose seven hydrocarbon reactions with strong intramolecular dispersion contributions as a benchmark set for newly developed density functionals. In general{,} the proposed composite approach is for many chemically relevant properties of similar quality as high-level coupled-cluster treatments. A significant increase of the accuracy for non-covalent interactions is obtained and the corrected B2PLYP DHDF provides one of the lowest ever obtained Mean Absolute Deviations (MAD) for the S22 set (0.2-0.3 kcal mol). Unprecedented high accuracy is also obtained for the relative energies of peptide conformations that turn out to be very difficult. The significant improvements found for the G3/99 set (reduction of the MAD from 2.4 to 1.7 kcal mol) underline the importance of intramolecular dispersion effects in large molecules. In all tested cases the results from the standard B3LYP approach are also significantly improved{,} and we recommend the general use of dispersion corrections in DFT treatments.},

  Abstract                 = {It is shown that the Hartree-Fock equations can be regarded as ordinary Schrödinger equations for the motion of electrons, each electron moving in a slightly different potential field, which is computed by electrostatics from all the charges of the system, positive and negative, corrected by the removal of an exchange charge, equal in magnitude to one electron, surrounding the electron whose motion is being investigated. By forming a weighted mean of the exchange charges, weighted and averaged over the various electronic wave functions at a given point of space, we set up an average potential field in which we can consider all of the electrons to move, thus leading to a great simplification of the Hartree-Fock method, and bringing it into agreement with the usual band picture of solids, in which all electron are assumed to move in the same field. We can further replace the average exchange charge by the corresponding value which we should have in a free-electron gas whose local density is equal to the density of actual charge at the position in question; this results in a very simple expression for the average potential field, which still behaves qualitatively like that of the Hartree-Fock method. This simplified field is being applied to problems in atomic structure, with satisfactory results, and is adapted as well to problems of molecules and solids.},

By accurately recalculating the RPA correlation energy as a function of electron density and spin polarization we demonstrate the inadequacies of the usual approximation for interpolating between the para- and ferro-magnetic states and present an accurate new interpolation formula. A Padé approximant technique is used to accurately interpolate the recent Monte Carlo results (para and ferro) of Ceperley and Alder into the important range of densities for atoms, molecules, and metals. These results can be combined with the RPA spin-dependence so as to produce a correlation energy for a spin-polarized homogeneous electron gas with an estimated maximum error of 1 mRy and thus should reliably determine the magnitude of non-local corrections to the local spin density approximation in real systems.},

In the first part of this paper a completely self-consistent solution of Fock's equations for the sodium lattice is carried through indirectly, this being the approximation in which one-electron functions are employed. The question of the correlations between electrons with parallel spin is investigated quantitatively and the Fermi "zero-point energy" is calculated using the proper effective field. The results show that the electrons behave almost exactly as if they were entirely free, the binding energy being 9 kg cal and the lattice constant 4.86A, as compared with the observed values 26.9 kg cal and 4.23A. To complete the picture, the correlations between electrons with anti-parallel spins are investigated in the latter part, since these are not included in the Fock picture. A general discussion of this question is presented and a quantitative treatment of its effect is made which yields a new binding energy of 23.2 kg cal and a lattice constant of 4.75A. The source of the remaining discrepancy is discussed.},

In the present article an intermediate point of view is adopted and the free-electron picture is employed in an investigation of chemical properties of metallic sodium. The assumption is made that in the metal the K and L shells of an atom are not altered from their form in the free atom. The properties of the wave functions of the electrons are discussed qualitatively, first of all, and it is concluded that the binding energy will be positive even when the Pauli principle is taken account of. This is followed by a quantitative investigation of the energy to be associated with the lowest state. First of all it is shown to what extent the present picture takes account of the interactions of electrons with both parallel and antiparallel spins, and to what extent remaining effects may be neglected. Next a Schroedinger equation is solved in order to determine the lowest energy level for various values of the lattice constant. To this a correction is made to account for the Pauli principle and from the result the lattice constant, binding energy and compressibility are calculated with favorable results.},

  Abstract                 = {We develop and validate a density functional, XYG3, based on the adiabatic connection formalism and the Görling–Levy coupling-constant perturbation expansion to the second order (PT2). XYG3 is a doubly hybrid functional, containing 3 mixing parameters. It has a nonlocal orbital-dependent component in the exchange term (exact exchange) plus information about the unoccupied Kohn–Sham orbitals in the correlation part (PT2 double excitation). XYG3 is remarkably accurate for thermochemistry, reaction barrier heights, and nonbond interactions of main group molecules. In addition, the accuracy remains nearly constant with system size.},

The title paper extended density functional theory to fractional electron number by an ensemble approach and proved that the energy is a series of straight lines interpolating its values at integer numbers of electrons. It also established that the highest-occupied exact Kohn–Sham orbital energy is the negative of the ionization energy, and showed that the exchange-correlation potential jumps by a constant as the number of electrons increases by an integer. These results are fundamental and continue to inspire developments in density functional theory.},

In addition, the functional satisfies the uniform electron gas limit, and it is better than the popular B3LYP functional, on average, for ground-electronic-state energetics.},
